<h1>Wildlife Images – Rehabilitation and Education Center</h1>
Wildlife Images is a private non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation established in 1981. 
We provide care and treatment for sick, injured, and orphaned wildlife indigenous to the Pacific Northwest, 
while giving the public an opportunity to experience wildlife first-hand. 
Located on 24 acres of “living laboratory” adjacent to the Wild and Scenic portion of Oregon’s Rogue River, 
approximately 12 miles west of Grants Pass, Wildlife Images receives and cares for over 1,000 animals every year 
at no charge to individuals or organizations. Additionally, we offer many educational programs for the public, 
through on site activities as well as through educational outreach programs.
