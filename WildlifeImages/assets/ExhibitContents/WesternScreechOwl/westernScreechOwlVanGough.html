<t1>Van Gough</t1>
<p>
Van Gough (presumed male) arrived at Wildlife Images on October 8, 2010. Van Gough was found by a concerned citizen driving on Elk Creek Rd. who found him sitting in the road. She stopped to pick him up & found that Van Gough had only one eye.
<p>
She brought him to our facility to receive care. Upon exam, several tears were found in his ear. Due to this & his missing eye unfortunately, Van Gough could not be released.  He has become a great addition to our educational program.
