<t1>Van Gough</t1>
<p>
Van Gough (presumed male) arrived at Wildlife Images in October of 2010. Van Gough was brought to us by a concerned citizen who noticed him on the road and found that he had only one eye. Upon examination, several tears were found in his ear. Due to this and his missing eye, Van Gough could not be released. He has become a great addition to our educational program.
