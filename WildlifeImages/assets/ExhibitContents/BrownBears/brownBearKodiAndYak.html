<t1>“Kodi” (male) and “Yak” (female)</t1>
<p>
Kodi and Yak are siblings. They were orphaned near Soldotna, Alaska in 1991. It was suspected that a territorial male had possibly killed their mother (which isn’t unheard of in the wild). They were transferred to Wildlife Images in September of 1992, while they were very young to hopefully be released back into the wild.
<p>
Unfortunately, the release never took place. Alaska may have had administrative changes that lead them to deny the release request. Kodi and Yak were treated like any other rehab animal and were not sequestered to avoid their attachment with humans. We all wish they could have been released, but they have been able to make an impact with many people here at Wildlife Images.
