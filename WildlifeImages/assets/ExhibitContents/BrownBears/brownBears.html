<t1>Brown Bears</t1>
<p>
There are 2 subspecies of the Brown Bears. The grizzly lives throughout the mainland of Alaska, throughout Canada, & in a couple of isolated populations in the lower 48 states. The Kodiak lives only on the Kodiak Archipelago. Grizzlies usually weigh between 800 & 1200 pounds. Kodiaks, because of their salmon-rich diet, often exceed 1500 pounds.
<p>
The diet of brown bear is about 50% meat & 50% vegetation. Unlike the black bear, which is fairly non-aggressive, & can tolerate living in the same enclosure with other black bears, the brown bear is more territorial; not in the sense of marking & defending a specific territory, but they are very defensive of their personal space, & they need a lot of it.
