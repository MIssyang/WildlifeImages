<t1>Jane</t1>
<p>
Jane came to us all the way from Palermo, Italy. An Italian Animal Rights Group received her from a pet shop. She somehow ended up at a pet store in Italy and was put up for sale. The animal rights group funded Jane’s trip back to America, after contacting Wildlife Images to find her a permanent home. She is the smallest bear in this enclosure but, don’t let her size fool you, she’s the boss!
