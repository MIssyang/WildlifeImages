<t1>American Black Bears</t1>
<p>
When viewing the black bears, please don’t walk past the point of the wolf entrance gate. The path in front of the cougar run is great, but please don’t go anywhere close to the black bear fence as it can shock you and your camera.

American Black Bears are usually 200-400 pounds. Although they are often classified as carnivores, their diet is more than 80% vegetation. They do eat some small animals and insects, & scavenge on fresh carrion, but the bulk of their diet consists of roots, grasses, sedges, fruits, nuts, and berries.
<p>
Their eyes and ears are relatively small; they don’t depend on sight and hearing all that much. However, they have an excellent sense of smell, as evidence by their large noses, and they can actually detect something up to 2 miles away. 
<p>
On the east coast, black bears are almost always black, but over here on the west coast, they may be black, brown, cinnamon, or even blonde. Sometimes people think they have seen a grizzly bear here in Oregon, but unfortunately the last Oregon grizzly was shot in 1931, so they have actually seen brown bears.
