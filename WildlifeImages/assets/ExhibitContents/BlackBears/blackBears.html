<t1>American Black Bears</t1>
<p>
American Black Bears are usually 200-400 pounds. Although they are often classified as carnivores, their diet is more than 80% vegetation. They do eat some small animals & insects, & scavenge on fresh carrion, but the bulk of their diet consists of roots, grasses, sedges, fruits, nuts, & berries.
<p>
Their eyes & ears are relatively small; they don’t depend on sight & hearing all that much. However, they have an excellent sense of smell, as evidence by their large noses, & they can actually detect something up to 2 miles away. 
<p>
On the east coast, black bears are almost always black, but over here on the west coast, they may be black, brown, cinnamon, or even blonde. Sometimes people think they have seen a grizzly bear here in Oregon, but unfortunately the last grizzly bear was shot in 1931 (in Oregon), so what they in fact saw was a brown black bear.
