<t1>Ted E. Bear</t1>
<p>
Ted E. Bear was kept as a pet & chained to a tree in the owner’s backyard in Denton County, Texas. Animal Control picked Ted E. up in 1995 after he was abandoned at the home. He was transferred to the Humane Society of North Texas in Fort Worth until arrangements were made to send him to Oregon. He then came to Wildlife Images for a permanent home.
