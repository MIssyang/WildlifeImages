<b>Black Bear Enclosure</b>
<p>
When viewing the black bears, please don’t walk past the point of the wolf entrance gate. This is not an appropriate area for tours to end up in. The path in front of the cougar run is great, but please don’t go anywhere close to the black bear fence.  Also don't hold your camera over the fence to try to get pictures; you will get shocked & so will your camera! We had a guest fry their $400 camera & they weren’t happy.
