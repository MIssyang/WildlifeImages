<t1>Characteristics</t1>
<p>
Most raptors are solitary creatures, hunting and eating alone. Harris Hawks’ will work together in family groups to cooperatively hunt and catch prey, and then share the meal. Sometimes, juveniles will stay with the family group for up to 3 years, and help raise subsequent broods. Because of their social ability and cooperative hunting techniques, Harris Hawks are often used in the sport of falconry.
