<t1>Common Raven</t1>
<p>
Common Ravens are acrobatic fliers. They are frequently seen to make rolls & somersaults in the air. They have even been observed flying upside down for as far as one kilometer (0.62mi). Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech and have a wide range of vocalizations. Onyx enjoys yelling out “help me”, “ouch”, & “French fries.” Common ravens have one of the largest brains of any bird species.
