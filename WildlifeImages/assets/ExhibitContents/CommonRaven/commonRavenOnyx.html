<t1>Onyx</t1>
<p>
Onyx (Presumed Male) came to Wildlife Images for rehabilitation in the summer of 2008, the same year he was hatched. Onyx was found by a member of the public not able to fly well. Upon his exam on intake, we discovered that he has a deformity on his wrist joint that prevents him from ever being able to fly well enough to be released. We don’t know for certain the reason Onyx was so imprinted, only that he came to us very tame & non- flighted.
