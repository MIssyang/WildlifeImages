<t1>Sacred Ibis</t1>
<p>
Sacred Ibis breeds in Africa, Iraq, and formerly in Egypt. This species is now extinct in Egypt where it was venerated in ancient times. The ancient Egyptians believed that their god Thoth sometimes came to earth in the form of a Sacred Ibis. Thoth, a scribe of the gods, was the inventor of writing and measurer of time who symbolized wisdom and knowledge.
