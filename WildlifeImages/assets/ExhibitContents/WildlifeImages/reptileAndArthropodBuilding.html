<t1>Reptile and Arthropod Building</t1>
<p>
The reptile and arthropod building houses the "creepy crawly" residents of Wildlife Images including 2 black pine snakes, which are becoming more and more rare in the wild, and a sinaloan milk snake with striking black, white and red coloration.
<p>
This building also houses two leopard geckos, two ball pythons, a Chilean rose haired and a Mexican red kneed tarantula, along with an entire colony of Madagascar hissing cockroaches. All of these are popular pet species but sometimes take their new owners by surprise with the amount of specialized care they require.
<p>
One of the newest residents in the building is an Eastern Box Turtle, a non-native turtle species to our area. He was a pet that someone could no longer care for. Along with a warm steady temperature, these animals require specialized diets including mice, meal worms, crickets, veggies, fruits and sometimes even vitamin powder to dust on their food. This Eastern Box Turtle is now very well traveled, joining us on many education outreach presentations.
