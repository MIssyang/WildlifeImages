<t1>Birds of Prey Center</t1>
<p>
The Birds of Prey Center is home to the feathered educational ambassador team, including: Bald & Golden Eagles, Eurasian Eagle Owls, Barn and Great Horned Owls, Ferruginous, Harris and Red-tailed Hawks, Augur Buzzards, Black and Turkey vultures and even Ravens. The building was designed not only to house the birds, but to train them as well.
<p>
The center corridor of the building serves as a training space where birds are trained to fly and go from one location to another when asked. The center also has its own kitchen where the resident daily diets are prepared. They eat a diet consisting of mice, rats, quail, rabbit and venison. Needless to say, the kitchen here looks much different than your kitchen at home.
