<t1>Black Vulture Hunting</t1>
<p>
Black Vultures often soar higher than Turkey Vultures and gather in large numbers at road kill and other carrion. They soar on thermals to gain altitude and to cover large distances with little energy expenditure. These birds spend much of their day searching for food in this manner.
