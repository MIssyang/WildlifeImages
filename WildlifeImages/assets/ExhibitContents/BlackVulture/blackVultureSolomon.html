<t1>Solomon</t1>
<p>
Solomon (male) was transferred to Wildlife Images in May of 2010 from a rehabilitation center in Northern Mississippi for a permanent home. Solomon was found as an orphaned 1 week old chick by a woman from England who was visiting her son in Mississippi. He was taken to a rehabilitation center in Northern Mississippi and unfortunately became too imprinted to be released into the wild, so he was transferred to Wildlife Images for a permanent home.
