<t1>Black Vultures</t1>
<p>
Black Vultures: The more southern of our two common vulture species, the Black Vulture flaps its wings rather frequently while it soars. The Black Vulture roosts in dense forests with large trees, and searches open spaces for carrion. Black Vultures are more common in flat lowlands than in higher elevations.
