<t1>Black Vulture Social Habits</t1>
<p>
<p>
The Black Vulture is monogamous and forms strong social bonds to its kin. They often congregate at communal roosts before going out to forage, and these gatherings give unsuccessful or inexperienced vultures a chance to follow others to carcasses. Black Vultures also rely on others in their group to warn them about approaching danger while eating, allowing them to eat more quickly.
