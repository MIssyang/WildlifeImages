<t1>North American River Otters</t1>
<p>
North American River Otters belong to the family Mustelidae, which includes weasels, badgers, skunks, and otters. Generally active at night, river otters often sun themselves on rocks or riverbanks during the day. They can stay underwater for up to four minutes, after which they must surface to breathe.
<p>
As they dive, they close their ears and nostrils to keep water out. They usually take over abandoned dens made by other animals such as beavers. Female river otters give birth in the spring. Babies are born blind and stay in the den until they're about one month old. When they are several weeks old their mother coaxes them into the water and they learn to swim.
