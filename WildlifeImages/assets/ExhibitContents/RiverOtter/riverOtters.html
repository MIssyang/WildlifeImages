<t1>North American River Otters</t1>
<p>
North American River Otters are generally active at night, river otters often sun themselves on rocks or riverbanks during the day. They can stay underwater for up to four minutes, after which they must surface to breathe. As they dive, they close their ears and nostrils to keep water out. They usually take over abandoned dens made by other animals such as beavers.
