<b>Golden Eagles</b>
<p>
Golden Eagles get their name from the gold colored feathers on their heads & necks. Like most species, they mate for life, & will often return to the same nesting site year after year. They will either fix up, or add on, to the previous year’s nest, or they may build more than one-just in case the main nest is destroyed. One golden eagle pair was documented to have built & maintained 12 separate nests during one breeding season!
