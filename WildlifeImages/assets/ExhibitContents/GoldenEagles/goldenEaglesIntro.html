<t1>Golden Eagles</t1>
<p>
Golden Eagles get their name from the gold colored feathers on their heads & necks. Like most species, they mate for life, & will often return to the same nesting site year after year.
<p>
They will either fix up, or add on, to the previous year’s nest, or they may build more than one-just in case the main nest is destroyed. One golden eagle pair was documented to have built & maintained 12 separate nests during one breeding season!
