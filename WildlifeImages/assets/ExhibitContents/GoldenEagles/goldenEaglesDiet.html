<t1>Golden Eagles Diet</t1>
<p>
Golden Eagles are one of the most powerful predators in the avian world. While they do show strong local preferences for certain prey, Golden Eagles are first and foremost opportunists and virtually any small to mid-sized animal may be predated if encountered.
<p>
Nearly 200 species of mammal and bird have been recorded as golden eagle prey. Typically they feed on rabbits, marmots, ground squirrels, and large mammals such as foxes. They will also eat carrion when food is scarce.
