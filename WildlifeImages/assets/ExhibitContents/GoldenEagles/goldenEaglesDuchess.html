<b>Duchess</b>
<p>
Duchess (female) came to us from the University of Washington’s Veterinary Department in June 2004. She arrived at their facility with a fractured wing after being hit by a car. After rigorous tries to stabilize & align the bone, unfortunately Duchess’ wing is permanently drooped, making her unable to fly. She is the largest Golden Eagle here at the facility. Many would argue that she’s the sweetest! After lots of physical therapy, it was deemed she couldn’t be released due to the limited range of motion in her wing. She was transferred to Wildlife Images for long-term care. for a permanent home.
