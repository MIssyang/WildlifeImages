<b>Sundance</b>
<p>
Sundance is one of the first residents of Wildlife Images, as he was brought to Dave Siddon Sr. in 1970 for rehabilitation (he was raised in captivity somewhere in the Portland, Oregon area) & moved to Oregon shortly after he was displaced from the nest, either by parents or an older tougher sibling. He is very dependant on humans & was a very active education team member for several years. He is now visited by tours almost every day, & still goes on a few educational programs.
