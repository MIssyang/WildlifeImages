<t1>Phoenix</t1>
<p>
Phoenix (presumed male) was actually a former resident of the Oregon Zoo. He was brought to them after being found as a malnourished chick on a logging road near Brookings, Oregon around 1980. He spent many years with Dave Siddon (Jr.) at the Oregon Zoo and flew in the birds of prey show there. Phoenix came with Dave to Wildlife Images in 1996 when Dave came to take his father’s place as director in 1996.
