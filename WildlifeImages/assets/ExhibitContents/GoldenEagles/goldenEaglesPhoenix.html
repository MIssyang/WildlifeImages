<b>Phoenix</b>
<p>
Phoenix (presumed male) was actually a former resident of the Portland Zoo. He was brought to them after being found as a malnourished chick on a logging road near Brookings, Oregon around 1980. He lived at the Oregon Zoo from 1980 to 1996. He spent many years with Dave Siddon (Jr.) at the Oregon Zoo & flew in the birds of prey show there. Phoenix came with Dave to Wildlife Images in 1996 when Dave came to take his father’s place as director in 1996.
