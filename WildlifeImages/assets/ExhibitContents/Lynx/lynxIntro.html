<t1>Eurasian Lynx Nikki</t1>
<p>
Nikki receives daily meals of his favorite foods, which include fresh chicken and quail. Nikki also thoroughly enjoys all of the attention our tours bring on a daily basis, and is anxiously awaiting his new enclosure in Critter Creek, the new riparian habitat at Wildlife Images. He definitely is NOT shy, and his purring can be heard from several feet away, although in true cat fashion, Nikki chooses who he does and doesn’t purr for!
