<t1>Nikki</t1>
<p>
Nikki, a Eurasian Lynx, is a beloved permanent resident of Wildlife Images. Nikki was born in captivity by an Oregon breeder in 1999 and purchased by an individual living in the state of Washington, who wanted him as a pet. Nikki was kept in a substandard and insecure enclosure, and after escaping several times, Nikki was confiscated by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.
<p>
Nikki made his way to his permanent home at Wildlife Images on November 19, 1999, and has been a treasured resident ever since.  Because Nikki was born and raised in captivity outside of his native area, he was never a candidate for release. His enthusiastic but wild nature combined with his large size makes a very good case as to why his species should never be a household pet.
