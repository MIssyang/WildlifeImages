<t1>Ruby</t1>
<p>
Ruby was found orphaned in a residential alley in Ashland, Oregon & brought to us August 1, 1999. She arrived as a very small, late in the season baby. She was in ill health & had to be hand reared to restore her health. Unfortunately, a combination of the necessary intensive care & the extra time spent at the facility due to her winter stay, she became very dependant & unafraid of humans, & was unfit to be released.
