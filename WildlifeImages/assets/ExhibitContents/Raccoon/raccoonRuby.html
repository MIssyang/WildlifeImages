<t1>Ruby</t1>
<p>
Ruby was found orphaned in a residential alley in Ashland, Oregon and brought to us in August of 1999. She arrived as a very small, late in the season baby. She was in ill health and had to be hand reared to restore her health. Unfortunately, a combination of the necessary intensive care and the extra time spent at the facility due to her winter stay, she became very dependant and unafraid of humans, and was unfit to be released.
