<t1>Raccoon</t1>
<p>
Raccoons are native throughout the Americas. They tend to live in forested areas, though they are quite good at adapting to civilizations, & can often be seen in towns. They are omnivores, & certainly opportunists, when it comes to diet. They do eat lots of aquatic prey: frogs, fish, & crustaceans. They are typically nocturnal, & solitary; they are excellent climbers, & can swim if necessary. They den in tree hollows & rock crevices.
