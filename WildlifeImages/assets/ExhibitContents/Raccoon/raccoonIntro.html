<t1>Raccoon</t1>
<p>
Raccoons are native throughout the Americas. They tend to live in forested areas, though they are quite good at adapting to civilizations, and can often be seen in towns. They are typically nocturnal, and solitary; they are excellent climbers, and can swim if necessary. They den in tree hollows and rock crevices.
