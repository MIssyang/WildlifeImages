<b>North American Badgers</b>
<p>
North American Badgers have a reputation for being mean & vicious. While badgers are rarely instigators of aggression, they can certainly be very defensive, & have even been known to back down a bear. Badgers are quite common in Eastern Oregon; they tend to live in areas of open country & loose soil. They are very efficient diggers, as evidenced by their long claws. They can actually dig faster than a person with a shovel. Badgers are technically omnivores, though their diet is primarily carnivorous. They eat a variety of rodents & other ground dwelling critters.
