<b>Badger Enclosure</b>
<p>
Nubs’ digging box is an old hot tub in the front of his house, & he is normally found digging & hiding in holes in true badger fashion. He is pretty curious, so he will come out to investigate what’s going on, but is often to work oriented to care about anything but dirt. If its winter time, badgers are usually pretty inactive, so expect to see less of Nubs as it gets colder.
