<t1>Badger Enclosure</t1>
<p>
Nubs’ digging box is an old hot tub in the front of his house, and he is normally found digging and hiding in holes in true badger fashion. He is pretty curious, so he will come out to investigate what’s going on, but is often too work oriented to care about anything but dirt. If it's winter time, badgers are usually pretty inactive, so expect to see less of Nubs as it gets colder.
