<t1>Nubs</t1>
<p>
Nubs arrived in March of 2006 from the High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon. He was orphaned & brought to us for permanent care. His mother had been hit by a car, & he was found as an orphan & was eventually transferred to us for permanent care. Nubs has become a very popular member of our educational team.
