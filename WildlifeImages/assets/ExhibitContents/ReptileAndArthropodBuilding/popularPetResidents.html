<t1>Popular Pet Residents</t1>
<p>
This building also houses two leopard geckos, two ball pythons, a Chilean rose haired and a Mexican red kneed tarantula, along with an entire colony of Madagascar hissing cockroaches. All of these are popular pet species but sometimes take their new owners by surprise with the amount of specialized care they require.
