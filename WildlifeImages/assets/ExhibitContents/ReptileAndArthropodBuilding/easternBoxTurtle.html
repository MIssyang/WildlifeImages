<t1>Eastern Box Turtle</t1>
<p>
One of our newest residents in the building is an Eastern Box Turtle, a non-native turtle species to our area. He was a pet that someone could no longer care for. Along with a warm steady temperature, these animals require specialized diets including mice, meal worms, crickets, veggies, fruits and sometimes even vitamin powder to dust on their food. This Eastern Box Turtle is now very well traveled, joining us on many education outreach presentations.
