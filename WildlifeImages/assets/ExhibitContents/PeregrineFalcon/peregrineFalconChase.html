<t1>Chase</t1>
<p>
Chase (presumed female) arrived at Wildlife Images on December 11, 2003. Chase was found injured in the Rogue Valley, Oregon. She had a wing fracture that unfortunately healed incorrectly. However, due to Peregrine Falcons very complex hunting style & flying ability, she was not able to be released because she is not able to use the wing as well as she would need to, making her unable to capture prey such as songbirds, a staple of Peregrine Falcons. The damaged wing droops slightly. We don’t know what caused her initial injury.
