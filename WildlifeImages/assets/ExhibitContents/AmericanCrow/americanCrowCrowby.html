<t1>Crowby</t1>
<p>
Crowby (presumed pale) arrived at Wildlife Images in December 2010. He was brought to our facility by Oregon State Police after being confiscated as an illegal capture. Because he had been in captivity for several months and raised by people, he was too imprinted to be released.
