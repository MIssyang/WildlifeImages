<t1>American Crow</t1>
<p>
American Crows can be seen flying around cities & neighborhoods. They often feed in family group, & then gather in larger flocks to roost at night. Communal sleeping groups are known as “roosts”. Did you know that crows are some of the smartest birds in the world? Crows are so smart that they can each other things using the “caw” sounds that they make. By changing their sounds, crows can warn each other of dangerous animals they see. Sometimes other animals are able to understand what the crows are saying & avoid danger.
