<t1>American Crow</t1>
<p>
American Crows are a familiar sight around most urban areas. They often feed as family groups, and gather in larger flocks to roost at night. Did you know that crows are some of the smartest birds in the world? Crows are so smart that they can teach other things using the “caw” sounds that they make. By changing their sounds, crows can warn each other of dangerous animals they see. Sometimes other animals are able to understand what the crows are saying and avoid danger.
