<t1>Sid</t1>
<p>
Obsidian "Sid" (presumed male) came to Wildlife Images on June 30, 2008 along with his sibling. On arrival he had a broken leg, but he and his sibling were otherwise healthy. Sid’s leg never healed well due to the fact that he was still a nestling and had to learn to stand and walk while his leg was in a sling. Due to his delayed physical healing, his mental development as a crow was also delayed.
<p>
It was also noted during his leg operation that he had permanent wing damage, which prevented him from flying. His flight issues made him unable to be a candidate for release. Sid however, spends the spring time as a foster dad to all the juvenile crows that come to our facility for rehabilitation, teaching them the ways of the crow.
