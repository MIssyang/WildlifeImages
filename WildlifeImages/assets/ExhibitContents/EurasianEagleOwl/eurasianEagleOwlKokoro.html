<t1>Kokoro</t1>
<p>
Kokoro (Female) was hatched in captivity at the World Bird Sanctuary, in St. Lois, Missouri in 2000. We acquired her at the age of 1 year in 2001 for our educational programs. Her name translates to heart or spirit in Japanese.  You’ll notice Kokoro has bright orange eyes. Whenever you see owls with yellow or orange eyes, you know they are crepuscular, which means they do most of their hunting at dawn and dusk.
