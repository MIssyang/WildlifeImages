<t1>Owl Ears</t1>
<p>
The Eagle Owl is related to the Great Horned Owl of North America, and exhibits the same feather tufts on the top of its head. Sometimes people think those tufts are ears, but really, owls have ear holes on the sides of their heads, which are asymmetrically placed. This positioning, along with concave nature of the owl’s face, allows it to pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from.
