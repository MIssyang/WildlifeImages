<t1>Eurasian Eagle Owl</t1>
<p>
Eurasian Eagle Owls are found in many parts of Europe, Asia, & Northern Africa. The Eagle Owl is related to the Great Horned Owl of North America, & exhibits the same feather tufts on the top of its head. Sometimes people think those tufts are ears, but really, owls have ear holes on the sides of their heads, which are asymmetrically placed.
<p>
This positioning, along with concave nature of the owl’s face, allows it to pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. You’ll notice Kokoro has bright orange eyes. Whenever you see owls with yellow or orange eyes, you know they are crepuscular, which means they do most of their hunting at dawn & dusk.
<p>
The Eurasian Eagle Owl is the largest species of owl in the world, by weight (each weighs about 7 pounds). Birds of prey always appear to be bigger & heavier than they actually are because of all of their feathers & the fact that most of their bones are hollow-an adaptation for flight.
