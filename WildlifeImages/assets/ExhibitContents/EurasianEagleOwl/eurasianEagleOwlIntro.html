<t1>Eurasian Eagle Owl</t1>
<p>
Eurasian Eagle Owls are found in many parts of Europe, Asia, & Northern Africa. The Eurasian Eagle Owl is the largest species of owl in the world by weight (each weighs about 7 pounds). Birds of prey always appear to be bigger and heavier than they actually are because of all of their feathers and the fact that most of their bones are hollow-an adaptation for flight.
