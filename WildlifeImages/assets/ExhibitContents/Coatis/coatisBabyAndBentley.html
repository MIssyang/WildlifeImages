<t1>Baby & Bentley</t1>
<p>
Baby and Bentley arrived at Wildlife Images in December of 2010. They were privately owned as pets. Their owners contacted Wildlife Images hoping to find them a permanent home because they could no longer keep them. Bentley and Baby have become part of our educational program.
