<t1>American Kestrel Intro</t1>
<p>
American Kestrels are North America’s smallest falcon, packing a predator’s fierce intensity into their small bodies. They are one of the most colorful of all raptors: the male’s slate-blue head and wings contrast elegantly with his rusty-red back and tail; the female has the same warm reddish on her wings, back, and tail. When perched, kestrels often pump their tails as if they are trying to balance.
