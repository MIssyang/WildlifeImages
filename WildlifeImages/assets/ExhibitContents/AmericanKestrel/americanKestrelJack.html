<t1>Jackson</t1>
<p>
Jackson (Presumed Male) arrived at Wildlife Images in July 2009. Jackson came to Wildlife Images in July of 2009 from Jacksonville, Oregon by a member of the public.  On admission it was discovered that he had an old fracture in his right wing that had fused incorrectly. Unfortunately, due to this he will never be able to fly. Jackson has become a great addition to our educational team.
