Kestrels hunt for insects and other small prey in open territory, by perching on wires or poles or hovering facing into the wind, all the while flapping and adjusting their long tails to stay in place. They usually snatch their victims from the ground, though some catch quarry on the wing. They are gracefully buoyant in flight, and are small enough to get tossed around in the wind.
