<t1>Red-Tailed Hawk</t1>
<p>
Cazadero (presumed male) arrived at Wildlife Images in May of 2005. Cazadero was transferred to Wildlife Images from Hawk Haven in Estacada, Oregon which was closed due to the passing on of their Director. He has a permanent eye injury and hawks depend on having 2 good eyes to hunt and live successfully in the wild.
