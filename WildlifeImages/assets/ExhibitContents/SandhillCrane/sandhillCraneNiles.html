<t1>Niles</t1>
<p>
Niles (male) was rescued as an egg after a forest fire in Alaska. He was hatched in his rescuers home, as he was still egg bound. He was cared for at an Alaskan rehabilitation center until he was old enough to forage on his own. Because of his young age, he became very imprinted on humans and was transferred to Wildlife Images in August of 1999.
