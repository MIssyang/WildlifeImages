<t1>Hedge Hogs</t1>
<p>
Sugar and Spice receive daily meals of their favorite foods – veggies and eggs for Spice and fruits and eggs for Sugar – and other nutritional necessities. They both thoroughly enjoy all of the attention our tours bring on a daily basis.
<p>
As valued members of our Animal Ambassador team, Sugar and Spice also occasionally travels to schools, educational programs, and local events with our Education Outreach Coordinators, teaching others all about the lives of African Pygmy Hedgehogs.
