<t1>Sugar & Spice</t1>
<p>
Sugar and Spice arrived at Wildlife Images on February 15th, 2010. Sugar came to Wildlife Images from a very unfortunate situation. On December 15th, 2009, a seizure was made on U.S. Global Exotics, an exotic pet breeding facility located in Arlington, Texas. The seizure of more than 27,000 animals was the largest exotic animal seizure in US history.
<p>
At the time of the seizure, more than 500 animals a day were dying in U.S Global Exotic’s care. Custody of all 26,411 surviving animals, which included reptiles, insects, arachnids, crustaceans & mammals, was awarded to the SPCA of Texas in February 2010. The survivors included more than 800 hedgehogs, which had all been living in a horse watering trough at the U.S. Global Exotics facility.
