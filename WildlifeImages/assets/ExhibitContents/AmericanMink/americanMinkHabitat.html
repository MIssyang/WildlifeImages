<t1>Habitat</t1>
<p>
Minks are semi aquatic animals and hence are found in wetland environment, usually near streams, rivers or any other water bodies. The mink population in a particular area depends on the food available to them within that area. Minks occupy the huts and burrows of muskrats and small mammals if the burrow is empty, or hunt down the current occupant and take the dwelling by force. Minks also live in cavities made by streams or trees.
