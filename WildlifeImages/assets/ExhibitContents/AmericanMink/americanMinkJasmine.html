<t1>Jasmine</t1>
<p>
Jasmine arrived at Wildlife Images in May of 2009. She was found as a tiny baby, with her eyes still shut, by some children playing at the Rogue River near the former Savage Rapids Dam. Somehow she ended up wedged between two rocks, & the concerned children picked her up & brought her to our facility. Because she had to be hand fed & had no other mink to learn natural habits from, she quickly became too imprinted on humans to be a good candidate for release. Jasmine became an official Wildlife Images’ resident in July of 2009.
