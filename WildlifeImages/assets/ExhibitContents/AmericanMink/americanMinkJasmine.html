<t1>Jasmine</t1>
<p>
Jasmine arrived at Wildlife Images in May of 2009. She was found as a tiny baby, with her eyes still shut, by children playing at the Rogue River near the former Savage Rapids Dam. Somehow she ended up wedged between two rocks, and the concerned children picked her up and brought her to our facility.
