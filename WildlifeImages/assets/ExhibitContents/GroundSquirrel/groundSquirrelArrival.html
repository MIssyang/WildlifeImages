<t1>Cheerio's Arrival</t1>
<p>
She was born in 2008 and came to us that summer as a juvenile. Upon her arrival, we knew she wouldn’t be able to make it in the wild long, due to her lack of camouflage. A member of the public brought her in because all her siblings were attacking her.  Cheerio is very active and likes to climb her screen to say hello, so be careful and don’t touch!
