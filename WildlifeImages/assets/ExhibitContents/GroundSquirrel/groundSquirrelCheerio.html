<t1>Cheerio</t1>
<p>
Cheerio is a Leukistic California Ground Squirrel. She was born in 2008 and came to us that summer as a juvenile. She is not a true albino due to the fact that she has blue eyes, not pink. She is considered Leukistic. This color pattern is obliviously not natural & is a genetic mutation, just like albinism.
<p>
Upon her arrival, we knew she wouldn’t be able to make it in the wild long, due to her lack of camouflage. A member of the public brought her in because all her siblings were attacking her.  Cheerio is very active and likes to climb her screen to say hello, so be Careful & don’t touch!
