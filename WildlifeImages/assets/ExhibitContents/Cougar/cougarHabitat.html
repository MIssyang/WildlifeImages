<t1>Cougar Habitat</t1>
<p>
Cougars, like wolves, & other top predators maintain the health of the land by keeping herd animals on the move. Deer, moose, & elk are prevented from overgrazing, which keeps vegetation abundant, which in turn keeps soil from eroding. Quite literally, the very foundation upon which all animals thrive is sustained by top predators.
