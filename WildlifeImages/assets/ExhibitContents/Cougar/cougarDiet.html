<b>Cougar Diet</b>
<p>
Cougars employ 2 hunting methods; concealed waiting & silent stalking. Cougars can walk virtually silently because the naked pads on the soles of their paws are surrounded by fur which absorbs sound as they walk. Cougars are strictly carnivorous, & will eat a variety of small & medium sized animals, though deer is their primary food source.
