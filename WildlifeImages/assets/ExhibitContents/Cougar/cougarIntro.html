<t1>Cougars</t1>
<p>
Cougars are also called mountain lions, pumas, panthers, catamounts, and painters, just depending on the region in which they are found. Unlike bobcats and lynx, adult cougars don’t have external markings; they are a uniform buff color, and camouflage very well. They have long, thick tails that help them to balance up in trees.
