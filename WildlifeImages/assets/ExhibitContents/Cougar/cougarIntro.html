<b>Cougars</b>
<p>
Cougars are also called mountain lions, pumas, panthers, catamounts, & painters, just depending on the region in which they are found. Unlike bobcats & lynx, adult cougars don’t have external markings; they are a uniform buff color, & camouflage very well. They have long, thick tails that help them to balance up in trees.
