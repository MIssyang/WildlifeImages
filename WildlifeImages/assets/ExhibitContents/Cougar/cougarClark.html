<t1>Clark</t1>
<p>
Clark was a previous pet. He was bought from a breeder by his owners who then became intimidated by Clark. He came to us through another facility that took him in temporarily to find him a permanent home. 
<p>
Clark’s tendons were clipped at a very young age so that he is unable to extend his claws. This has caused him further problems with his feet, & his story continues to support the idea that these wild animals should not be kept as pets.
