<t1>Turkey Vulture Habitat</t1>
<p>
Turkey Vultures are scavengers; they eat dead animals, called carrion. This sounds gross, but vultures perform a very necessary service. Rotting bodies harbor bacteria and spread disease, not to mention look and smell bad. Vultures, and other carrion eaters, help keep the ecosystem healthy by cleaning up those messes. They are often called “nature’s garbage trucks”.
<p>
Vultures have naked heads-an adaptation for carrion feeding. Feathers would collect bits of food and blood, and be difficult to clean. Vultures, as a group, are more resistant to pathogens and disease than any other type of bird.
