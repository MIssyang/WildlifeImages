<t1>Turkey Vulture Habitat</t1>
<p>
Turkey Vultures are scavengers; they eat dead animals, called carrion. This sounds gross, but vultures perform a very necessary service. Rotting bodies harbor bacteria & spread disease, not to mention look & smell bad. Vultures, & other carrion eaters, help keep the ecosystem healthy by cleaning up those messes. They are often called “nature’s garbage trucks”.
<p>
Vultures have naked heads-an adaptation for carrion feeding. Feathers would collect bits of food & blood, & be difficult to clean. Vultures, as a group, are more resistant to pathogens & disease than any other type of bird.
