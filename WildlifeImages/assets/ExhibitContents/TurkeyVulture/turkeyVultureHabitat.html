<t1>Turkey Vulture Habitat</t1>
<p>
Bald Eagles, Ospreys, & Turkey Vultures are all migratory species. They depend on wetlands to provide food, water, & shelter along their migratory routes. Turkey Vultures are extremely dependant on thermals for migration, & you know that spring has arrived in Southern Oregon when you see the first Vultures back in the area.
