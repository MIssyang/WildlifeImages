<t1>Turkey Vulture Habitat</t1>
<p>
Bald Eagles, Ospreys, and Turkey Vultures are all migratory species. They depend on wetlands to provide food, water, and shelter along their migratory routes. Turkey Vultures are extremely dependant on thermals for migration, and you know that spring has arrived in Southern Oregon when you see the first Vultures back in the area.
