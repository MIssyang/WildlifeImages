<t1>Rufus</t1>
<p>
Rufus came to us on August 30, 2002 from the Summer Lake, Oregon area. He was confiscated from a family that picked him up out of the den before his eyes were open, & kept him in their home for several months. He was brought to us by Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife volunteers to become a permanent resident, as he was already very human dependant.
