<t1>Rufus</t1>
<p>
Rufus came to us in August of 2002 from Summer Lake, Oregon. He was confiscated from a family that picked him up out of the den before his eyes were open, and kept him in their home for several months. He was brought to us by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife volunteers to become a permanent resident, as he was already very dependant on humans.
