<t1>Bobcats</t1>
<p>
Bobcats get their name from their short, bobbed tails. They all have spots and little tufts of fur on the tips of their ears. It is believed that these tufts help filter sound waves down into their ears while they are hunting. Like all cats, they have retractable claws; keeping them in the paws prevents them from wearing down and becoming dull; they can extend them to climb trees.
<p>
They are able to go for long periods without food, but will eat heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it will often prey on larger animals that it can kill and return to feed on later. They hunt animals of different sizes, and will adjust their hunting techniques accordingly. Typically they feed on rabbits, rodents, squirrels, birds, and fish.
