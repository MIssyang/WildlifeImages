<t1>Shoshoni</t1>
<p>
Shoshoni came to us in March of 1999, after she was picked up illegally from the wild as a kitten in Idaho. She was fed an improper diet at a young age & was in poor health. Because she was picked up illegally, & it is not confirmed where she came from, she could not be released in Idaho or Oregon. This makes yet another case that these animals are not good pets.
