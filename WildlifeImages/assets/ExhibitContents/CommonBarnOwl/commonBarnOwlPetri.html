<t1>Petri</t1>
<p>
Petri (female) arrived in 1994 as an egg. Her nest was located in a haystack that traveled from Klamath Falls to Grants Pass by truck, along with 3 other eggs. She was brought to us in a “Petri” brand cigar box (hence her name) and placed in an incubator along with the other 3 eggs; Petri was the only one to hatch. She was hand-raised by our animal care director and became imprinted.
