<t1>Petri</t1>
<p>
Petri (Female) arrived in 1994 as an egg. Her nest was located in a haystack that traveled from Klamath Falls to Grants Pass by truck, along with 3 other eggs. She was brought to us in a “Petri” brand cigar box (hence her name) & placed in an incubator along with the other 3 eggs; Petri was the only one to hatch. She was hand-raised by our animal care director & became imprinted.
<p>
In 1999, Petri escaped from her enclosure & was found several days later a few miles away from our facility in a mud puddle, being harassed by crows. Petri lost weight during her week of freedom leading us to assume she hadn’t eaten much, if anything. Unable to fend for herself, Petri has become a beautiful & spirited member of our educational program.
