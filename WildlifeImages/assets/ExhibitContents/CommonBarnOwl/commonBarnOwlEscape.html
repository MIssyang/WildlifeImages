<t1>Escape Attempt</t1>
<p>
In 1999, Petri escaped from her enclosure and was found several days later a few miles away from our facility in a mud puddle, being harassed by crows. Petri lost weight during her week of freedom leading us to assume she hadn’t eaten much, if anything. Unable to fend for herself, Petri has become a beautiful & spirited member of our educational program.
