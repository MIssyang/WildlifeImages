<t1>Common Barn Owl</t1>
<p>
Barn Owls are the most common species of owl, found on every continent, except Antarctica. They are quite adaptable, & can live in a variety of habitats. Natural roosting sites include caves & tree hollows, but it’s not uncommon for them to take up residence in an abandoned building or barn.
<p>
They are referred to as Nature’s Mousetrap because of their efficiency at catching mice & rats. Weighing a little less than 1 pound themselves, they will eat up to their body weight in mice a night!
