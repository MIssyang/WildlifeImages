<t1>Beauty's Arrival</t1>
<p>
Beauty flew into a tall building which housed a furniture store in Medford, Oregon. Somewhat underweight when found, she was rehabilitated, returned to the Medford area and released, where she flew into the same building again. This time she was taken to a local ophthalmologist and was examined. It was determined that she was blind in one eye and has limited vision in the other. She would therefore be unable to hunt and survive in the wild.
