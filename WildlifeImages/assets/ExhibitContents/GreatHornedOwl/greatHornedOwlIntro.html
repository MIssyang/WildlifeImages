<t1>Great Horned Owl</t1>
<p>
The Great Horned Owl is the most common owl of the Americas, easily recognized because of the feather tufts on its head. These “plumicorns” resemble horns or, to some, catlike ears. Owls are efficient nighttime hunters that strike from above, & use their powerful talons to kill & carry animals several times heavier then themselves.
<p>
Owls prey on a huge variety of creatures, including raccoons, rodents, rabbits, squirrels, songbirds, falcons, & other owls. They regularly eat skunks (so, we know their sense of smell can’t be too good) & may be the only animal with such an appetite.
