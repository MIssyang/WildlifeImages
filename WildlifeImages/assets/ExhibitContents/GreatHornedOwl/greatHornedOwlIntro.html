<u>Buddy</u> (Female) - Arrived at Wildlife Images in October 1997.<br>
An orphaned hatchling, Buddy arrived in the summer, slated to be released when she reached adulthood. Before her release date she escaped from her mew as it was being cleaned & ended up at a house a short distance from Wildlife Images. Apparently hungry, Buddy was easily enticed into a transport kennel with a piece of meat & was returned to her enclosure. When it was time for her “official” release, she flew to a nearby yard & we were once again called by the homeowner. After this second attempt of a release, Buddy joined our educational program, too imprinted to be released into the wild.

<u>Snoozer</u> (Male) - Arrived at Wildlife Images in 1992.<br>
Snoozer was a fluffy little orphan owlet when he was discovered on the ground in a cemetery by the caretaker’s dog. He was hand-raised by our animal care staff & became quite imprinted. A release failure, Snoozer joined our educational program.
