<t1>Snoozer</t1>
<p>
Snoozer came to Wildlife Images in 1992. He fell (or was kicked) out of the nest in a local cemetery as an owlet. Apparently, the caretaker’s dog picked up Snoozer & brought him to the man, who brought Snoozer to us.
<p>
He has very irregular growth patterns in his beak & talons, which would have significantly decreased his chances in the wild. Because he came to us so young, he is also people oriented, & will actively hoot at people. A release failure, Snoozer joined our educational program.
