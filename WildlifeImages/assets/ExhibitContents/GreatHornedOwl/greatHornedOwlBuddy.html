<b>Buddy</b>
<p>
Buddy (female) arrived at Wildlife Images as a tiny owlet in May of 1999. She was found on the ground, & had probably been kicked out or fell out of the nest. Buddy arrived in the summer and was slated to be released when she reached adulthood. Before her release date she escaped from her mew as it was being cleaned & was later found on a private residence’s porch a short distance from Wildlife Images. She apparently hadn’t gained hunting skills & the ability to live in the wild and was easily enticed into a transport kennel with a piece of meat & was returned to her enclosure. When it was time for her “official” release, she flew to a nearby yard & we were once again called by the homeowner. After this second attempt of a release, Buddy joined our educational program, too imprinted to be released into the wild.
