<t1>Buddy</t1>
<p>
Buddy (female) arrived at Wildlife Images as a tiny owlet in May of 1999. She was found on the ground, and had probably been kicked out or fell out of the nest. Buddy arrived in the summer and was slated to be released when she reached adulthood. Before her release date she escaped from her mew as it was being cleaned and was later found on a private residence’s porch a short distance from Wildlife Images.
<p>
She apparently hadn’t gained hunting skills and the ability to live in the wild and was easily enticed into a transport kennel with a piece of meat and was returned to her enclosure. When it was time for her “official” release, she flew to a nearby yard and we were once again called by the homeowner. After this second attempt of a release, Buddy joined our educational program, too imprinted to be released into the wild.
