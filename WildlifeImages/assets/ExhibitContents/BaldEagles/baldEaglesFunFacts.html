<b>Bald Eagle Fun Facts</b>
<p>
The longest living Bald Eagle, in captivity, lived to be 69 years old. Of course any animal/bird in captivity have a much longer life span. In captivity, they are provided excellent health care & they don’t have to worry about habitat destruction, food shortage, encroachment, or many of the other worries they face in the wild.
