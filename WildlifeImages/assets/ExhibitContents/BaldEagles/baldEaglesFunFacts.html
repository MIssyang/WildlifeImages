<t1>Bald Eagle Fun Facts</t1>
<p>
The longest living Bald Eagle, in captivity, lived to be 69 years old. Of course any animal in captivity have a much longer life span as they are provided excellent health care and they don’t have to worry about habitat destruction, food shortage, encroachment, or many of the other worries they face in the wild.
