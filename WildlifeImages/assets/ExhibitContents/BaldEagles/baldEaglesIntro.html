<b>Bald Eagles</b>
<p>
Bald Eagles can live in a variety of habitats, but usually found near a water source. Fish make up a large part of their diet, but terrestrial prey such as squirrels, mice, & rabbits, are also eaten. Bald Eagles are important predators of smaller birds, including waterfowl, which keep their populations in check. Bald Eagles don’t actually acquire their white feathers & yellow beaks until they are 3-5 years old; juveniles are all brown, & are sometimes mistaken for golden eagles. Bald Eagles are usually around 7 years old before their heads are completely white.
