<u>Miss Jefferson</u> (Female) - Arrived at Wildlife Images in 2005.
<BR>
Miss Jefferson came to Wildlife Images after being found at the base of a tree. It is believed that she either fell out of her nest on her own or had possibly been pushed out by a larger sibling. Upon arriving, she was given a medical exam which led to the discovery of both her wings being severely fractured. Because of this Miss Jefferson would never be able to fly again. She however, has become our most vocal resident.
