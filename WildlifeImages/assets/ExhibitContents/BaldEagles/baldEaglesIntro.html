<t1>Bald Eagles</t1>
<p>
Bald Eagles can live in a variety of habitats, but usually found near a water source. Fish make up a large part of their diet, but terrestrial prey such as squirrels, mice, and rabbits, are also eaten. Bald Eagles are important predators of smaller birds, including waterfowl, which keep their populations in check.
<p>
Bald Eagles don’t actually acquire their white feathers and yellow beaks until they are 3-5 years old; juveniles are all brown, and are sometimes mistaken for golden eagles. Bald Eagles are usually around 7 years old before their heads are completely white.
