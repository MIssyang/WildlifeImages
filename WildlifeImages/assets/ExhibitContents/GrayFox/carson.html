<t1>Carson</t1>
<p>
Carson came to us in spring of 2004 as a small kit, or baby fox. It was apparent upon examination that he would not be able to survive in the wild due to a genetic condition that didn't allow his legs to grow properly. He has made a wonderful addition to the educational animal ambassador team.
