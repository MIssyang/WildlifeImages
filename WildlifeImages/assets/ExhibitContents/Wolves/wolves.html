<t1>Gray Wolves</t1>
<p>
Gray Wolves do not have to be grey. They can be black, white, or any shade in between, but they all have a thick layer of insulating fur next to their skin, and that’s always grey. Anatomically and physiologically, wolves are built for traveling long distances.
<p>
They have long, strong legs and hard pads on the soles of their paws. Their cardiovascular and respiratory systems are made for endurance. They spend a lot of time chasing down prey and patrolling their territory. A single pack may have a home range of 800 square miles.
