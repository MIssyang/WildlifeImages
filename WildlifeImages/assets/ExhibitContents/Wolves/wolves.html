<b>Gray Wolves</b>
<p>
Gray Wolves do not have to be grey. They can be black, white, or any shade in between, but they all have a thick layer of insulating fur next to their skin, & that’s always grey. Anatomically & physiologically, wolves are built for traveling long distances. They have long, strong legs & hard pads on the soles of their paws. Their cardiovascular & respiratory systems are made for endurance. They spend a lot of time chasing down prey & patrolling their territory. A single pack may have a home range of 800 square miles.
