<b>Wolf Pack Dynamics</b>
<p>
In the wild, wolves live in family groups of 8 to 12 individuals. There is an alpha male & alpha female; they are the leaders of the pack, & usually the only breeding pair. There is also an omega who is the scapegoat of the group. It’s the one that gets picked on; whenever there is tension or stress, it is taken out on the omega. This doesn’t sound very nice, but the omega plays a very important role in the functioning of the pack. It’s the one that helps instigate play, helps break up fights, & in various ways relieves the tension of group living. If the omega dies or moves up in rank, a new one must be established within a couple of weeks. The pack can’t function without the presence of the omega.
