<t1>Wolves Enclosure</t1>
<p>
There is some poison oak that grows along the fence line, so please stay back from the fences. Tundra is an educational ambassador and gets very curious when people are about. Staying back isn’t only for your own safety, it also prevents the wolves from accidently hitting the hot wire that runs the perimeter of their enclosure either.
