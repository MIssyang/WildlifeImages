<t1>Lakota</t1>
<p>
Lakota is a Gray Wolf and arrived in 1997 from a primate rescue facility in Las Vegas. She came from very mysterious circumstances. We really don’t know anything about her history, except that it was probably not a happy one, but now she is den mates with Tundra, and they get along wonderfully.
