<t1>Tundra</t1>
<p>
Tundra is a gray wolf and arrived in February of 2002 as a small pup. She was transferred from the Sarvey Wildlife Center in Washington. She was delivered there, & there are no records of where she came from previously, or what circumstances led her to be abandoned at the animal sanctuary in Washington. However, Tundra has a very loving disposition with her handlers here, & loves going on walks.
