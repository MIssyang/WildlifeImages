<t1>Wolf Territory</t1>
<p>
Anatomically and physiologically, wolves are built for traveling long distances. They have long, strong legs and hard pads on the soles of their paws. Their cardiovascular and respiratory systems are made for endurance. They spend a lot of time chasing down prey and patrolling their territory. A single pack may have a home range of 800 square miles.
