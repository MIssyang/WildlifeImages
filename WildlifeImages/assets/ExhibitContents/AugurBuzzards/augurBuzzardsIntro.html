<t1>African Augur Buzzards</t1>
<p>
Outside of North America, the term “buzzard” is used instead of hawk. The Augur Buzzard is native to Africa, & has two color phases. In the light phase, of which Augie is an example, the front half of the bird is white & the back is a slate grey. In the dark phase, of which Beruti is an example, the whole bird is grey to black.
